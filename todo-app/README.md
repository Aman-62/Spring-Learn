### Folder Structure

- **node_modules** Contains all dependencies required by the app. Main dependencies also listed in package.json
- **public** Contains static assets that can be accessed directly by the browser
- **src** Contains all source code for the app, In the simplest form it's the brain of our app. This is where we do all the our work. scr/main.jsx is the Javascript entry point
- .gitignore Specifies which files source control(Git) should ignore
- package.json Contains metadata for our project, including dependencies, scripts, and other settings
- package-lock.json A snapshot of the entire dependency tree
- README.md A file that contains information about our project
